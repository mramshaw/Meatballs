# Meatballs

Exporing deployment options in the Cloud

[Full disclosure: I have never seen "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" but the title stuck with me.]

## Motivation

While researching competitors to AWS for hosting my [ReactAWS](http://github.com/mramshaw/ReactAWS)
repo, I ended up trying out many of them. Which didn't really fit into the goals of that particular
project - which was to write a React app and deploy it to AWS.
